  <p>
    Hi! I am a fourth-year undergrad in the school of EECS, Peking University.
  </p>
  <p>
    I explore the intersection of <em>cognitive science</em> and <em>language models</em>, hoping to understand how humans and LMs think and learn. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I am fortunate to have worked with Professors <a href="https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html" target="_blank">Heng Ji</a>, <a href="https://www.tshu.io/" target="_blank">Tianmin Shu</a> and <a href="https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/yizhouwang/index.htm" target="_blank">Yizhou Wang</a>.
    
    I am also deeply greatful to my amazing mentors, <a href="https://wentao.live/about.html">Wentao Zhu</a> and <a href="https://glaciohound.github.io/">Chi Han</a>, for their invaluable guidance and support along the way.
  </p>
