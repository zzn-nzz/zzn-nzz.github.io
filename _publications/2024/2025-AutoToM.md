  We introduce AutoToM, an automated agent modeling method for scalable, robust, and interpretable mental inference. Leveraging an LLM as the backend, AutoToM combines the robustness of Bayesian models and the open-endedness of Language models, offering a scalable and interpretable approach to machine ToM.
